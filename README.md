# AggroScan: Multilingual Aggression Detection using NLP

AggroScan is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) project focused on detecting aggression in textual data across multiple languages, including English and Telugu. This project leverages machine learning techniques to classify and analyze aggressive content, which can be particularly useful in moderating social media, forums, and public discussion platforms.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to:
- Detect aggressive statements in text datasets.
- Handle multilingual datasets (English and Telugu).
- Build and evaluate classification models for aggression detection.
- Provide insights into language-specific patterns of aggression.
